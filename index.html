                <p>Hello there. </p>
                <p>My name is Cliff and I'm a web developer in the SF bay area. I graduated from UC Irvine and
                    Thinkful's Engineering bootcamp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I take pride in being able to learn anything fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding I enjoy skiing, playing guitar, rafting whitewater, and board games like chess and
                    go.
                </p>

            <h2>Why I code.</h2>
            <p>You know that feeling you got when you were a kid running up against that installation error on some PC
                game? </p>
            <p>
                DirectX. Or was it something about the drivers? You know you can Google/Yahoo your way to victory.

            </p>
            <p>
                And finally that game you've been wanting to play for the past three hours finally boots up.
            </p>
            <p>
                And there's no sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another 30 minutes spent and you've got it working - and it's perfection because you made it work
                yourself.

            </p>
            <p>
                That's the feeling that keeps me coding.
            </p>

            <h2>Career.</h2>
            <p>I started my professional life cold calling and doing trades for a foreign exchange brokerage.
                <p>

                    I soon
                    moved into yield and pricing for a few big media companies and managed teams of analysts.</p>
                <p>Now I code.</p>
